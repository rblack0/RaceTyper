The Plan =-=-=-=-=-=-=
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Idea: We are making a program that small businesses
would be able to utilize that tracks sales and processes it into useful information and outputs to a file.

What information is contained in an item?
ITEM_NAME PRICE
  - How will these items be organized?
  - We can throw them into a HashMap<ITEM_NAME, ITEM>
Item.toString
  - Displays item information in a well-formatted manner
Item.compareTo
  - Compares the item to another item using user-inputted specifications

IDEA:
1. Would you like to open a current sales document? Y/N
2: Would you like to create a new sales document? Y/N
  Name for the file
  Enter in the new products
  Save that
3: What would you like to do?
  Record a sale
    item by number with a list of items to enter?
    Enter x items with y sold
  View current sales
    Find a good way to visualize this within
  Output the sales to text
    Organized by: (?)
    Price, Alphabetical
  Exit / Close the program

  Description:

  Interactive text based game for children/adults that want to practice typing. User gets fed a stream of sentences and must type them correctly as fast as they can before the timer runs out.
  Create a linked list consisting of nodes that each hold a sentence/line of text and int value representing time in seconds (maybe even msecs)
  


Features to Implement:

  - Time 
    Use Java's inbuilt function to measure elapsed time
    

  - Calculating WPM
    Could count all of the words in the input file and count how many letters they consist of 
      Then use 1 letter as the base unit of score?

  - Spell Checker
    Use strcmp() in order to check correctness
      eg. if it returns 0, we know the sentence was typed correctly verbatim, else, we either dock points or make the user waste time by retyping

  - File input
    .txt file that has whatever you want to practice typing, eg. a paragraph, excerpt from a book, snippet of code etc...
      Could be copy pasted from where ever

  - Variable Difficulty Levels
    Longer paragraphs to challenge endurance
    Shorter time limit to challenge speed

  - Feedback Responses Depending on Degree of success
    Could be playful, supportive, or even have tips/tricks as feedback for next time
      "Remembering to be mindful of your posture and comfort can help improve your typing speed!"

  
  - Leaderboard
    Compare past and present scores to see progress (or lack therof)
      eg. "This time your wpm/score increased by 12%!"

1.Would you like to create a new paragaph to practice? Y/N
2.Create a new LL with the users paragraph.
  Each node contains one sentence
  Pointer to next node
3.Are you ready to practice? Y/N
4.3...2...1 Start!
4.One sentence at a time, 10 seconds to type it.
    Strcmp, if its wrong end the game.
5.
